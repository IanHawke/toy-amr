# Adaptive Mesh Refinement

A toy Python Adaptive Mesh Refinement code

## AMR

Berger-Oliger Adaptive Mesh Refinement is about efficiently solving hyperbolic partial differential equations. It uses nested grids to improve accuracy in regions where it is needed.

## Previous codes

This is meant to extend a [previous toy code](https://github.com/IanHawke/toy-conslaw) for solving conservation laws in Python to build in the AMR techniques used in a different [previous toy code](https://github.com/IanHawke/amr1d) that used Fortran.
